# What is Universal Network Scanner
*Universal Network Scanner* is a multi-brand ultra-fast network discovery tool based on multicast and broadcast discovery. 
This network discovery scanner is implemented based on a flexible framework to ease implementation of any vanilla discovery IP protocol such as SSDP/UPnP, mDNS, proprietary discovery protocols, etc.

# Participate
If you own some device that are currently in the implementation list, you can contact me if you want to help for technical tests.
If you want to propose a new protocol, you can send me relevant data following this [procedure](https://github.com/julienblitte/UniversalScanner/blob/master/doc/Collect%20data%20for%20new%20protocol.docx).

**Current helps is wanted for: Foscam cameras, Dlink cameras, Hid access control, Lantronix device (such as Vauban acces control)**.

If you have such devices, and are happy to help, please contact me.
